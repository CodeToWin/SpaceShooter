# SpaceShooter

This is my first attempt at making a game in Phaser. You can control a spaceship with the arrow keys and spacebar to fire. 
You face waves of incoming UFOs of two different varieties. Dodge their attacks and kill off the wave to start the next.
With each wave, the enemies move and shoot faster. See how far you can get!
